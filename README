NAME
    PPI::XS - XS acceleration for the PPI perl parser

DESCRIPTION
    PPI::XS provides XS-based acceleration of the core PPI packages. It
    selectively replaces a (small but growing) number of methods throughout
    PPI with identical but much faster C versions.

    Once installed, it will be auto-detected and loaded in by PPI completely
    transparently.

    Because the C implementations are linked to the perl versions of the
    same function, it is preferable to upgrade PPI::XS any time you do a
    major upgrade of PPI itself.

    If the two fall out of sync, the integration between the two is designed
    to degrade gracefully. PPI::XS is capable of determining which functions
    are no longer equal, and will simple leave the perl version alone,
    deleting the C version to free up the memory.

    If the versions of the two get so far apart that they become completely
    incompatible, PPI::XS will simply silently not load at all.

    Beyond that, there isn't that much more you really need to know. :)
